Core:
 - domain modules live in packages/core/src/modules/<domain>
 - public API via package.json exports and src/index.ts

Effect:
 - prefer Effect.Service for services; export Tag/Layer as needed
 - services suffix with "Service" to not clash with type defs

Config:
 - use Effect Config for env parsing/validation
